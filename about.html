            <p>
                My name is Sujithra, and I am from Thiruvallur district. I am the first graduate in my family and come
                from
                a single-parent background, which taught me responsibility and self-discipline from an early age.
            </p>

            <p>
                I completed my schooling in Tamil medium, and although transitioning to English with 93 % during my
                B.Sc. Computer
                Science was challenging, consistent effort helped me improve.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scoring 99 marks in Python in my first semester strengthened my confidence and interest in programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                Growing up, I observed several issues in my area, which developed my interest in solving real-world
                problems
                using technology. This inspired me to build projects such as a Village Information Website and a Smart
                Public Complaint Management System to address community challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also working on a team project called a Learning Management System (LMS). Currently, I am enhancing
                my
                skills at the Freshworks STS Software Academy and growing as a full-stack developer through hands-on,
                real-world projects.
